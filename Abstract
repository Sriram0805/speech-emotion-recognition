Emotion recognition using speech processing involves analyzing vocal features to
identify the emotional state of a speaker. This multidisciplinary field leverages signal
processing and machine learning techniques to extract and interpret acoustic properties such as
pitch, tone, rhythm, and intensity from speech signals. By training algorithms on annotated
datasets, systems can learn to classify emotions like happiness, sadness, anger, and fear with
varying degrees of accuracy. Applications of emotion recognition span various domains,
including human-computer interaction, mental health monitoring, and customer service, where
understanding the emotional context can enhance user experience and provide valuable insights
into human behavior. The ongoing advancements in deep learning and the availability of large,
diverse speech databases continue to drive improvements in the accuracy and robustness of
emotion recognition systems.
